# ColoringPics Logo Placeholder

Please replace this file with your actual colorful camera logo image.

The logo should be:
- A colorful camera icon as shown in the user's image
- PNG format
- Square aspect ratio (1:1)
- High resolution for crisp display
- Saved as `public/logo.png`

The current Logo component is set up to display this image at 24x24 pixels in the header.
